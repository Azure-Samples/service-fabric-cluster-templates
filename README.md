# Service Fabric Sample Cluster templates

## Details

This repository contains sample Service Fabric cluster templates that you can customize for use in setting up your clusters.

* The intent is to provide a wide variety of templates, based on the customer input and the types of clusters we have seen our customers create.
* The templates cover both Windows and Linux clusters

## Other

Although, we try to keep a wide variety of templates to suite broad customer needs, there will be ones that are not in here as samples, If there are templates, you feel we should add as samples, then either contribute that to the repo. or raise a git-hub issue to get one added.

## Backlog

1) Linux cluster templates with Network Security Group on.
2) Cross Az Cluster template
3) Cross regional cluster template
